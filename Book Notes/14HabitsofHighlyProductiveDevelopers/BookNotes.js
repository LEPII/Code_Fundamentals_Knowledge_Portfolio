// Habit 1: Look For The Signals

// Practice Jomo - The Joy Of Missing Out 
 
// This means being happy and content with what you already know. Give yourself some credit and look back on everything that you have learned so far. 

// Find a balance of practicing your existing skills and learning new ones. 

// Self awareness is crucial to identify what’s a signal for you to look into and what is just noise. The noise will always be there. Cherry pick what is relevant for you in your career. Accept the fact that you can’t simply learn everything. 

// Desires are endless, needs are limited. 

// Newer is not always better. Say no more so that you can focus on what really matters to you. 

// TODO #1

// Create a list of all of the technologies that you would like to learn
// Label each one with a different priority 
// Add Due Dates  

// Focus on 

// What are the most must-have technical requirements of whatever I’m working on? (Performance, UX etc)
// How easy would it be for others to work on what I’m building? And what will it look like for them to integrate it in with whatever other projects that they’re working on? 
// Is what I’m doing in-line with the trajectory of the open web standards and specifications I believe that will stick around over the long term? 

// “You can’t learn everything, but you can learn enough to be effective”

// Ask Yourself

// Does it improve my productivity?
// Does it improve the user experience of the types of projects that I usually build? 

// If the answer to either question is yes, you should consider looking into the tech more in depth. 

// TODO #2 

// Add more options to the following list - Ask AI for help

// Before considering 
// What problem is this new technology / frame trying to solve? 
// How is it different from existing frameworks and technologies? 
// Do I need to learn something new to be able to learn it? 
// Can I take advantage of my existing skills and knowledge? 
// Does the framework use a language that I already know? 
// What about infrastructure? 
// Are there cloud providers that support the new technology? Or can my existing infrastructure support it? 

// Also look into the overview of the tech, to know what it’s about. 

// There’s no such thing as too much knowledge. 

// If a lot of companies are adopting the technology, maybe it's worth a deep dive and try to learn more advanced concepts about it. 


// Habit 2: Focus On The Fundamentals

// If you decide to become a great developer, it ‘s important to understand core concepts such as algorithms, logic, network, accessibility, security and user experience. - You don’t need them to build your first app but knowing them will help you build the next 10 complex applications that you will create in the future. 

// 14habits.com/bonus/2

// Spend some time researching what the fundamental concepts in your fields are. 
// Grab a piece of paper and write it into 2 columns - left side list all of the knowledge you already have. On the right side, list all of the knowledge that you still need to apply. Plan a dedicated time of your day to study those concepts. 

//  Q - How would you approach learning a new programming language today? 

// A - 

// A1 - Basic understanding of the key concepts on how others solve similar problems with it. This usually covers a lot of best practices. You can see patterns on how certain structures are used. And from there, it’s easy to find documentation with reasoning on those choices. 

// Learning a new language usually comes to me when it needs to be applied to a project. 

// Having peer reviewers that are familiar with the language in the team's codebase is also very important to quickly learn new things while making progress. 

// Understand everything that you write. Whenever you find yourself confused on a certain concept or someone suggests a new feature that I never saw before, I try to read the documentation and understand the theory behind them and be confident on why that is the best choice possible. 

// A2 - I would learn a new programming language by picking one of my exisiting pet projects and rewriting it using this new programming language. IMO this is the most efficient way to learn a new language because I can focus 100% on just learning the new language and nothing else. Picking a new project requires picking and planning new features and other things that would take your focus away from learning the language. 

// A3 - ABC - Always be coding. Make it a habit to consistently work on it. WHILE GOING THROUGH DOCUMENTATION - reference the documentation and popular open source projects to help frame your foundation and build our habits as close as possible to those already experienced in that particular language!!! 

// RESILIENCE IS THE BEST FUNDAMENTAL 

// Habit 3: Teaching Equals Learning

// If you really want to learn something, you have to teach it. The process of digesting content to someone is what makes you really understand it. The process of writing down how to do something is what makes you memorize it. The process of teaching is what make you truly learn it. 

// You have to do it in public. You need a human being listening on the other side.

// GIVE TALKS. 

// Its important to note that you do not need to be an expert in a topic to present a talk.

// Habit 4: Be Boring

// In the software world, intensity is always praised. There’s a fine line between intensity and burn out. When the intensity becomes a normal behavior, stop and reflect.

// Intensity is a tool that you should use on special occasions. 

// Disciple, consistency and persistence - the key to playing infinite games. 

// Developers that are playing the infinite game are less worried about the intensity and more worried about the consistency. They don’t know when exactly they will see the result, still they all know that it will work. 

// Q - Think about the best programmer that you have ever worked what did they do constantly that made you think that way?

// A1 - I learned a lot from people who had a good schedule or agenda in their lives. They were always on time. Starting and finishing their workday on the perfect hour every single day. All these people showed me that I can only win if I smartly organize my day and avoid procrastination. In general, I think most of them had a positive impact in my life. Encouraging me to always bulls a simple and straightforward work pattern. Not too much on my plate and not too little. 

// A2 - Value high integrity  High integrity developers are focused on the outcomes and why it’s important. They are the ones that proactively call something out if something is wrong, or call you out if your plan or direction needs adjustment. They are the ones that will take on a project that is not so glamorous just because it’s important to get it done. They are the one that are beside you helping you find solutions when things go south. 

// A3 - The best are reliable. You can’t have consistency without reliability. They know it’s not worth it to work long hours as the next day, you won’t be rested enough to think clearly. They know it’s essential to have fun and eat well. 

// A4 - They were all extremely disciplined. The discipline these developers had seemed to be like a super power early on in my career. They always had time to write great code, comprehensive test coverage and explain the nitty gritty details of their commit messages. These disciplined developers don't work all through the night and stress about shipping the next feature. They invest their time in doing things well and communicating clearly. In my exp, that makes others on the team less of a need to rush and enables them to invest time improving their existing work and immediately moving onto the next task. 

// You’ll be able to spot this at companies - which behaviors are praised / frown down upon. You want companies that think more in the long term mindset. 

// IN THE INTERVIEW, YOU CAN PRONE THIS IN A QUESTION ON WHAT TYPE OF PERSON THEY ARE LOOKING FOR. SO IF THEY’RE LOOKING FOR THE MOST TALENTED, THE MOST EXPERIENCE, THE OVERALL PERFORMERS - IT COULD MEAN THAT THEY ARE IN THAT FINITE GAME MENTALITY. 

// ON THE FLIP SIDE - IF THEY’RE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE WITH INTEGRITY, PEOPLE WITH DISCIPLINE, PEOPLE THAT TREAT OTHER PEOPLE WELL, THAT MIGHT BE AN INDICATOR THAT THEY WANT TO BUILD A TEAM FOR THE LONG RUN.  


// Habit 5: Do It For Your Future Self 

// It’s hard to focus on writing efficient code when you have pressure from your boss with crazy deadlines to meet. Still many of us go for those experiences at least once in our work lives. 

// Just write readable code. Think about maintainability. 

// Ask yourself this question 
// Will the future me understand the intention of this code?

// Top 5 Books:
// 14habits.com/bonus/5

// To Do 

// Open up a project and ask yourself, is there any refactoring that makes your future’s life easier? 

// Q & A 

// Q - What are things you do today to help yourself in the future?

// A - A critical skill to a developer is the ability to look around corners. There are likely many paths that you could take that would lead to success to your present deliverable but choosing the one that sets up the next version of success and the 5 after that is more challenging. When thinking about this, I tend to look at larger industry trends, the progression of where I believe technology will be in 3 - 5 years. And what emerging standards appear solid enough to bet on? You’re not only going to find something actionable to incorporate for every project you undertake. But when you do, a small amount of vacation to your course early on a project can significantly change where you end up over time. 

// A - Is this code readable for anyone with any level of experience? - With that in mind, I tend to:

// 1.  write code with meaningful variables, methods, and class names. Do not assume that other people, including myself, will understand short names that don’t mean much or a term that could change meaning over time.

// 2. Have good automated testing. This will give additional documentation about your code and also help anyone that needs to touch that code in the future. 

// Use a version control as documentation. When the project evolves, changes and bug fixes are madea all the time. In the future, when it becomes legacy code, no one will be able to understand the decisions and changes made at this time if they're not documented. The commit and pull request history is a good tool to explain the Why’s. 

// A - Have good standards for the best practices, and for these to be followed by the team. This goes beyond styling. This goes all the way to which pre-existing tools to use for certain known problems. Re-inventing the wheel is something most of us are compelled to do. But a quick search can reduce the amount of code added. Code that could require future maintenance. It also helps avoid familiar mistakes that have already been solved by good developers. 

// Early optimization is the root of all evil. It’s easy to write a one liner without a comment that doesn't do exactly what we need, but it’s very hard to debug such a line down the line. 

// Peer Reviews are extremely useful to avoid such pitfalls. Whenever you need too much context to understand what a line, component, method is doing, you should step back and ask the coders to include more meaningful variables with meaningful names or add a few comments on why it was done this way. 

// Always test everything that you write. Unit testing, integration testing, performance and benchmark testing, all of it. Enforcing a simple policy of no new code with unit tests can work wonders. You can definitely know the difference between code bases that apply it and those that don’t. 

// If tests are taken as a fundamental aspect of a project and are given the right priority, then it’s easy for the team to spare some cycles on working on better testing tools. The quality of test code is as important as the quality of the production code and the infrastructure like continuous integration etc. 

// No code should be added without unit tests and no code fix without a regression test. Such small tests will have an impact on the overall quality of the project. 

// It’s okay to have a legacy. If it’s doing the job it needs and it’s not critical for the business to operate that fine but if it’s something that’s critical then it’s something that needs to be dealt with and make a case for it. 

// Habit 6: Your 9-to-5 Is Not Enough

// “Don’t count on motivation, count on discipline.”

// If you want to have a successful career in tech, you need to invest extra hours into your craft. You don’t want to conform to how your company writes and structures the code with their tech stack. If you’re new to your career, you need to expand you skill set to new technologies in your free time. 

// Habit 7: Master The Dark Side

// Getting information from a key stakeholder can be very tricky since we all have a different understanding of the system.

// Know the Dark Side - “the business side” -  can help you.

// Save Time - even if you span dozens of hours planning before you start working on a particular feature, you will always uncover new implementations and edge cases that affect your implementation. The better you understand the business, the more capable you will be to solve those problems yourself. When you find exception to a rule, you are more likely to already know the answer instead of having to schedule a meeting with the domain expert to find a solution 
// Prevent Complex Code - Over complexity often is never really reused or extended, generating a grave yard of code.
// Better Prioritize - With better business knowledge, its easier to priortize the micro decisions you need to make when coding. You can anticipate which part is more important to spend time on. You can put yourself in the user’s shoes and feel their pain. When you know what the most important business functionailty are, you can more than likely write high quality code in that area which would prevent future refactoring. Every industry is different, so there is no recipe to follow when it comes to better knowing the business side, 
// - our recommendation is to start with the vocabulary. PAY attention to the specific terms and words used by the business folks. If you emulate the same terminology, the communication with them will be much more effective. Once you start consuming / reading more content about that industry, you will naturally develop more domain knowledge.

// A PERSON WHO KNOWS HOW TO CODE IS POWERFUL, A PERSON WHO KNOWS HOW TO CODE AND KNOWS HOW BUSINESS WORKS IS UNSTOPPABLE 

// To Do
// Elaborate a list of the most common terms used in your industry. Start a conversation with your colleagues to better understand their areas. What marketing niches are being targeted? What are the most common questions for customer support? How is your product different from those with competitors? What does the sales funnel look like? 

// QA

// Q - Do you try to understand the business side of something before you program something? 

// A1 - It depends on the complexity of the work and the time, because very often we can get the job done very well with understanding little to nothing about the business, that being said, knowing more about the business, the more valuable we are to the team because that would allow use to both our tech skills and biz knowledge to make a greater contribution

// Reverse engineer your paychecks and ask yourself, how did the business accumulate this paycheck? How is the business operating? - YOU COULD GIVE IDEAS TO IMPROVE THE BUSINESS, REVIEW PRIORITIES AND ASK MYSELF WHAT ABOUT THIS OTHER THING THAT COULD BE MAKING MORE MONEY OR SAVING MORE MONEY IF WE TACKLE XYZ. 

// WHEN STARTING NEW JOB 
// Companies have their own vocabulary. List down the words you don’t know yet, understand it. 
// Developers often do the reverse with people who are not technical, we need to provide space for an open discussion. It’s a dance between both parties. 

// We have to ask QUESTION 

  
// Habit 8: Side Projects

// To invent, you have to experiment. If you know in advance that it’s going to work, then it’s not an experiment. Big companies like Twitter started off as side projects. 

// If you’re just starting your career, side projects could be a tremendous opportunity to grow your portfolio, resume, and showcase your skills. If you already have an established career, side projects could be very useful. They allow you to experience and learn new skills that your daily work might not offer and use all of your creativity while doing it. 

// First step is to decide what you want to build. WHat ideas are worth pursuing? 
// Side projects = giving up personal hours so you need to ask yourself, do I really enjoy this subject, field or type of work? IF no, chances are you won’t have the energy to spend extra hours working on it. 
// It takes time for side projects to gain side traction. Ask yourself, am I willing to spend 5 years working on an idea, if not, it is likely that I will lose motivation and will end up giving up the project before it takes off, however if my goal is to just experiment, then I don’t need to worry about this at all. 
// HAving an idea is one thing, having the ability to acutely understand that idea is completely different. So ask myself, can I execute this idea fully by myself, if not, consider learning a new skill or inviting a friend to fill the gaps. 
// Saying yes to an idea is saying no to a bunch of other ideas, so ask myself, is this particular idea better than the other ahead in the basket? 
// Understanding who you are building the solution for is vital. IF you don’t know your audience, then it will be unlikely that you will understand their needs. Ask yourself: “Do I personally experience this problem, or am I solving it for someone else? If not, then consider reaching out to people who have actually experienced the pain that you’re trying to solve. You might be surprised with what they have to say.”
// Ask “Why am I excited about this idea? It is crucial to understand your underlying motivation. Do you want to learn a new technology, do you want to make more money or do you need a distraction from other problems?” - Be honest with yourself. More important is choosing the scope of your project - many side projects won’t see the light of the day. 

// TO DO’s 
// Experiment with similar apps. Can you create a better version of that? Have a notebook with all of your side project ideas and take it everywhere with you. When you’re ready, pick one of those ideas and give it a try. 

// Q / A 
// Q - Do you have a record of building side projects? What has been the impact of your career? 

// Your ability to build projects can give you the ability to build libraries and tools that can be used by others. As long as you’re having fun, building cool s**t, and learning something out of experience, it’s worth it. 
// Side projects can give you a better understanding of technologies that you’re already using in your day to day work. 

// OPEN SOURCE YOUR PROJECT 
// YOU HAVE TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PARTICIPATE - BUILD A SITE 

// Habit 9: Mario or Sonic

// “Because pain is the universal constant of life, the opportunities to grow from that pain are constant in life. All that is required is that we don't numb it, that we don't look away. All that is required is that we engage it and find the value and meaning in it.”

// In the beginning of your career, it might be okay to switch jobs frequently, you might want to have new experiences, however there is a side effect. The less time you spend in a project, the more superficial you will be as a professional. 

// In contrast, the more time you spend on a project, the more opportunities you have for long term impact. Both are amazing and both have the potential to save the world. 

// TODO 
// Think about the 3 things you love/hate about your job. Is there anyway you can turn those bad parts into good parts? 

// Q / A 
// Q - What was the longest job you had? Why did you stay there for such a long time? 
// Think about every job as an investment level. It’s not just about the money, it’s about the return of the investment for your career as a hole. 
// It’s very important that you’re satisfied with your current job regardless of the pay or how far along you are in some career ladder. 

// There’s always a trade off. Being like Mario could give you more rewards like a high status or more money (easy way out) )but you lose the opportunity to build meaningful relationships / impact within the company. Choosing to be like Mario could impact your career and your teams. If we think about the people that we want in our teams, we would also like them to also be sonics and have that continuity and stability and even the attitude of pushing through hard things, if we have someone next to us who just jumps at the first sign of little improvement. 

// Every employer looks at that. They don’t want people who are always rotating because there is a huge cost in training, onboarding, etc. There’s only a certain level of impact you can have if you stay short term. 

// If the company is providing you with that platform that always keeps you interested, provides new problems for you to solve then why should you leave?  

// If you’re early in your career, we suggest finding a good company with the flexibility and autonomy and have a quality company to work for, they will grow as you grow. There’s some company that you’re just filling a role and there’s nothing wrong with that but depending on what you’re looking for, maybe you want that growth and that flexibility as you grow your career 

// Habit 10: Active Listening

// “Wise men speak because they have something to say, fools because they have to say something” 

// A company is simply a group of people and if you want to become effective there, you need to be able to communicate well, even if you are an introvert. Conversations are always a two way street but it doesn’t mean you need to speak just because. 

// We need to listen to understand, not to reply.  

// When having a higher ranking tough conversation, it could be very easy to show a lack of patience, to be aggressive and to show power and authority. In contrast when having a lower ranking difficult conversation, it could be very easy to stop paying attention or to put the blame on someone else.We all have to deal with conflicts and this is where we can show our best side or our worst side. 

// Everyone you meet is fighting a battle that you know nothing about, be kind always 

// TODO 
// In your next meeting, choose to practice your listening skills. Instead of being the first to say something, wait until everyone has shared their ideas and be the last one to speak.

// Q / A 
// Q - How do you communicate with other team members? 
// “I’m convinced that the only efficient manner of communicating in remote jobs is by providing as much context as possible.”

// A1 - We PR must provide context for the reviewer to continue in their own time zone. Creating issues for PR’s is sometimes required.
// It’s super important to always talk about the code and not the other person. You never know what is happening to the person on the other side of the screen. It’s vital to always be polite and nice. 

// A2 - Communication is an art that needs to be followed every day.

// A3 - Efficiency is about doing more with less. Ethicacy is about doing it successfully. In order to convey a message successfully, you almost always have to repeat the message a couple of times. 

// Context could play a huge role. The less context shared, the less effective communication is which is effective in team building. 

// It takes a lot of effort but it is essential for leaders.

// Effective but inefficient communication is much better than the opposite. It’s the job of the leader to add efficiency over time. 

// Low communication has a compound effect. More distance from the team to a point where no one knows even if you’re on the team anymore. 

// Opening your camera at a meeting is something small yet effective. 

// Habit 11: Don’t Underestimate

// There’s no such thing as solving the problem twice. And every task is associated with some sort of business challenge. 

// Stakeholders NEED deadlines and you’ll need to answer them back. 

// In our desire to impress others, inability to say no to others, lack of planning for non coding related activities, we end up underestimating tasks, missing deadlines and losing trust. How can we get better at estimates? 

// It’s impossible to be 100% accurate with estimates. Unexpected problems will always occur. 
// Separating large tasks into smaller improves estimates. 
// Decompose tasks that will take no more than 2 days of effort. 
// Estimate in ranges - worst case, most likely case, best case for a task
// For first time development with a language or tool, compare with development using a familiar language or tool
// Document and communicate the assumptions embedded in your estimate 

// Treat estimation discussion as problem solving not negotiation. Recognize that you and the stakeholder are on the same side of the table. Experienced programmers may not be as experienced in providing estimates. A developer not involved in the estimation process will not get good at estimation. 


// TODO 
// Next time someone asks for an estimate, note down your answer. Tack yourself and compare how long you took to your original answer. 

// Q / A 
// Q - How Do You Estimate Tasks
// A1 - If you live by underpromise and over deliver when it comes to software estimates, you’ll be in good company and communicating those expectations is key. 


// Habit 12: Specialist vs. Generalist

// Once you’ve reached a certain mid- senior level you can either decide to become a specialist or a generalist? 

// The answer depends on self awareness. What types of task mostly motivate you during your workday? 

// SPECIALIST  
// Pros 
// You can receive very good $ in that specific field 
// You can gain a lot of technical authority in a certain subject 
// You only need to keep up to date only in one platform or language 
// Companies are always looking for specialists in a certain field. 
// Cons
// It could be hard to find a position if the position is too narrow 
// If the chosen tech has become absolute, it could be hard to start from the bottom again 
// Your knowledge could be too company dependent. 
// Work Opportunities
// Senior positions especially at big companies 
// Research projects at Universities 
// Freelancer in a specific field. 

// GENERALIST  
// Pros 
// You’re used to learning new tech 
// There’s a variety of opportunities that you could pursue in different industures. 
// IF you need a new job, you’re flexible and easy to transition. 
// Cons
// It’s difficult to stay up to date with multiple technologies. 
// It’ll take you longer to solve complex tech specific problems. 
// It might be easier to find a new position but it might be harder to prove that you are the better candidate.
// Start Ups
// StartUps and Early Stage Companies. 
// Consulting Opportunities 
// Starting Your Own Business 

// Leaders are often generalists. Create a habit of asking yourself: 

// How can I better help my team? 
// If it means learning something new, so be it. If it means not coding at all, so be it. When individual success is not a priority, you could go much further than you think. 

// TODO
// Examine your work day/week. What are the parts that drive you the most? What type of work would you rather do? Examine your company/team. What are they struggling with the most? Is there anything that you could help them with? 

// Q / A 
// Q - Do you consider yourself to be a specialist or generalist? Which one is better in your opinion? 

// A1 - Learn how to learn so that you could learn something and become functionally capable in a certain area as quickly as possible. Doesn’t mean you need to be a full on specialist, it just means that you understand the most critical points that drives decision and to see them in a way that a veteran sees them. 

// Seek mentors who are willing to let you ask them a lot of questions and get over the feeling that your questions are naive. A good mentor will make you feel comfortable asking questions like that . 

// Frequently ask for reviews. When you get feedback, focus on absorbing the most optimal patterns, not just learning an answer to an isolated problem. Do this with the humble attitude of a student and you can become the best of both a specialist and generalist. 

// A2 - 

// Habit 13: Control Your Variables

// “You might not be able to control a situation but you can control how you view it.”

// Habit 14: Stop Waiting
