# JWT

**What is a JWT?**

A JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard for representing claims securely and compactly. It's commonly used to authenticate users, authorize access to resources, and exchange information between different systems.

Authentication:
The user provides their credentials (username and password) to the server.
The server verifies the credentials against a database or other authentication mechanism.
If the credentials are valid, the server generates a JWT containing information about the user (e.g., user ID, roles, permissions).

Token Issuance:
The server sends the JWT to the client.

Token Storage:
The client typically stores the JWT in a secure manner, such as in a cookie or local storage.

***JWT Validation on the Server Side***

The server validates the JWT on every request:

Token Verification:
The server extracts the JWT from the request.
It verifies the JWT's signature to ensure it hasn't been tampered with.
It checks the expiration time to make sure the token is still valid.

Claim Extraction:
The server extracts claims from the JWT, such as the user's ID and roles.

Authorization:
The server checks if the user has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource based on the claims in the JWT.

***JWT Validation on the Client Side***

While it's possible to validate JWTs on the client side, it's generally not recommended for security reasons. If a malicious actor intercepts and modifies the JWT, a client-side validation wouldn't detect the tampering.

***Storing JWTs on Web Applications vs Mobile***

Web Applications:

Cookies: Commonly used.
Pros: Larger storage capacity than cookies
Can be accessed from JavaScript for custom logic
Cons:
Can be accessed by client-side JavaScript, making it potentially vulnerable to attacks
Data persists across browser sessions

Local Storage: Provides more storage space but can be accessed by JavaScript, making it potentially vulnerable to client-side attacks.
Pros:
Larger storage capacity than cookies
Can be accessed from JavaScript for custom logic
Cons:
Can be accessed by client-side JavaScript, making it potentially vulnerable to attacks
Data persists across browser sessions

Session Storage: Similar to local storage but data is lost when the browser window or tab is closed.
Pros:
Data is lost when the browser window or tab is closed, improving security
Cons:
Limited storage capacity
Cannot be accessed across different browser windows or tabs

Mobile Applications:
Keychain (iOS): Provides secure storage for sensitive data.

Pros:
Highly secure, designed to protect sensitive data
Provides strong encryption and authentication mechanisms
Cons:
Can be complex to implement, especially for beginners

SharedPreferences (Android): Similar to local storage but offers more flexibility and security features.

***Overall Considerations***

Security: For sensitive data, prioritize storage methods that offer strong encryption and protection against attacks.

Persistence: Consider whether you want the data to persist across browser sessions or device restarts.

Accessibility: If you need to access the JWT from JavaScript for custom logic, Local Storage or cookies might be more suitable.

Platform Compatibility: Ensure the chosen storage method is compatible with your target platforms.

Complexity: Weigh the trade-offs between ease of implementation and security.

***Best Practices for Storing JWTs***

Secure Storage: Use secure storage mechanisms provided by your platform (e.g., Keychain on iOS, Keystore on Android).

HTTP-Only Cookies: If using cookies, set the HttpOnly flag to prevent JavaScript access.

Secure Context: Ensure the JWT is transmitted over HTTPS to protect against eavesdropping.

Regular Token Refresh: Implement a mechanism to refresh the JWT periodically to prevent unauthorized access.

Avoid Storing Sensitive Data: Don't store sensitive information directly in the JWT, as it could be compromised if the token is leaked.
