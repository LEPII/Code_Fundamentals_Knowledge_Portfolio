/// RESTful Services

// Representation State Transfer
// We use simple http protocols principles Update and Delete data.
// Every http request has a verb or a method that determines its type of intention. 
// HTTP Methods: GET, POST(creating), PUT(updating), DELETE
// Ex. Req = GET /api/customers/1  ==> Res = {id: 1, name""}
// If you're doing POST/PUT request, you should but you should also include the 
// customer object in the body of the request.
