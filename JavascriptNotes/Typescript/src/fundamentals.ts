//// - General

// TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language.

// - Statically Typed - TypeScript allows you to define the types of variables, function parameters, and return values. This means the compiler can check for type errors during development, catching potential issues early on.
// - Superset of JavaScript - Any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. This means you can gradually introduce TypeScript into existing JavaScript projects.
// - Transpiles to JavaScript - TypeScript code is not directly executed by browsers. It is first transpiled (converted) into plain JavaScript using a TypeScript compiler (usually called tsc).

let num: number = 12;
if (num < 10) 
    num += 2;
