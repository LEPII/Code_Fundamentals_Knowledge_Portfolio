# Request Processing Pipeline in Express.js

The request processing pipeline in Express.js is a series of middleware functions that are executed sequentially when a request is received by the application. Each middleware function has the opportunity to modify the request or response object, or to pass control to the next middleware in the chain.

Here's a breakdown of the typical request processing pipeline:

Request Received: The Express.js application receives an HTTP request.

Middleware Chain: The request is passed through a chain of middleware functions. Each middleware can perform various tasks:
Parsing: Middleware like express.json() or express.urlencoded() parses the request body into a JavaScript object.
Authentication: Middleware can verify authentication credentials (e.g., JWT tokens).
Authorization: Middleware can check if the user is authorized to access the requested resource.
Logging: Middleware can log request details for debugging and analysis.
Error Handling: Middleware can catch and handle errors that occur during request processing.

Route Matching: The request is matched to a specific route handler based on the URL and HTTP method.

Route Handler Execution: The matched route handler is executed, which typically involves:
Processing the request data (e.g., from req.body, req.query, or req.params).
Performing any necessary business logic.
Preparing the response to be sent back to the client.
Response Sent: The response is sent back to the client, including the status code, headers, and body.
