//// Types of Tests ////

/// Unit Tests

// Unit testing focuses on testing individual, isolated components. These "units" are typically functions, methods, or small classes. It can be  typically be written alongside the code itself.
// This can help with things like early bug detection and refactoring with confidence + faster feedback.
// A guideline for how many unit test should be written for a given function should be greater than or equal to the number execution paths.

///

/// Integration Tests
// Integration testing focuses on verifying the interactions between different parts of the software making sure they work together correctly.

///

/// End-To-End Tests
// End-to-end testing simulates real-world user scenarios to verify the entire application flow from start to finish.
